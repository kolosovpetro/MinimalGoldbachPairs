# Goldbach pairs

## Definitions

Goldbach conjecture states that every even integer $N$ greater than 2 is a sum of two primes.

$$N = p_i + p_j$$

where $(p_i, p_j)$ is called Goldbach pair.

Goldbach pair is not unique for some even integers, meaning that there can be multiple goldbach pairs for even integer $N$.

For example:$10=3+7$ and $10=5+5$ and $10=7+3$ where goldbach pairs are $(3,7), (5,5), (7,3)$.

## Minimal goldbach pair

Minimal goldbach pair is the one which has minimal $p_i$ across all goldbach pairs for even integer $N$.

For even integer $10$ we have three pairs $(3,7), (5,5), (7,3)$ while the minimal is $(3,7)$ because 
$3$ is the minimal value in the $p_i$ set: $3, 5, 7$
